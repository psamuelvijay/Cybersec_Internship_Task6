README: Password Strength Evaluation Summary

This project evaluates password strength using a popular online tool, highlighting what makes a password strong or weak.

Key Learnings:

Strong passwords have at least 12 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid predictable patterns like repeated characters, sequential numbers, or common phrases.

Password complexity directly impacts resistance to brute force, dictionary, and other guessing attacks.

Tools like passwordmeter.com provide detailed feedback to help create better passwords.

Use unique strong passwords for different accounts, preferably generated and stored with password managers.

This evaluation helps understand how password complexity affects security and guides creating robust passwords for better protection.
